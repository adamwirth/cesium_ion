# Next up

Tasks for me to do next time I have 30+ minutes to sit down!

- Remove db-migrate.js in favor of new setup
- Refactor db-rollback.js for new packages
- Start adding testing
  - Read up on Jasmine as it has been maybe 10 years since I used that!
  - Possibly bump it if this supplied code had an old version that is breaking
  - Test to check I made the proper things optional/non-optional. The default is "notNull" and I feel like having it be inverted is error-prone
  - Test to generate a bunch in a second and see if I can crash it. I might not be able to generate them fast enough, but I'll try
- Make github repository for this. Double-check that it should be public or not; I don't want to mess that up if this is a supplied assignment
- Remove knex from package.json/package-lock.json
- Review the package.json scripts and remove others
- Review the readme.md and change things that arent accurate anymore
