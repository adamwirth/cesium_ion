# Next up

Tasks for me to do next time I have 30+ minutes to sit down!

- Fixing/adding testing
  
  - Test to generate a bunch in a second and see if I can crash it. I might not be able to generate them fast enough, but I'll try
- Review the readme.md and change things that arent accurate anymore
