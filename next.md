# Next up

Tasks for me to do next time I have 30+ minutes to sit down!

- Fixing/adding testing
  - I am in a esm/commonjs battle that I am too tired to know how to figure out how to fix it. there must be some way to compile one to the other where I can use the files and test them... I'm at the 4 hour mark now.
  
  - Test to generate a bunch in a second and see if I can crash it. I might not be able to generate them fast enough, but I'll try
  - Rethinking if server.js is an entrypoint, in that maybe it should be able to be extracted as a helper, for tests
- Make github repository for this. Double-check that it should be public or not; I don't want to mess that up if this is a supplied assignment
- Review the readme.md and change things that arent accurate anymore
